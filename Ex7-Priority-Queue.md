# Ex7 Priority Queue
### DATE: 03/03/2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters. 
3. Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1. 
4. Print each element of the array during the loop. 
5. After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting. 
6. End the program.

## Program:

    int i; 
    for(i = 0; i < size; i++) { 
        printf("%d ", array[i]); 
    } 
    printf("\n");
