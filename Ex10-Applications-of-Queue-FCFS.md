## AIM:
To write a C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm.

## Algorithm
1. Start with process, burst time, and waiting time arrays. 
2. Loop through each process from i = 0 to n-1. 
3. Compute tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i]. 
4. End the algorithm.  

## Program:
```

```
int turnaroundtime(int proc[], int n, int burst_time[], int wait_time[], int tat[]) {
    int i; 
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) 
        tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i]; 
    return 0; 
}
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus, the C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm is implemented successfully.
